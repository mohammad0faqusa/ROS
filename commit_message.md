# Add basic project structure, launch file, and README

---

### Step 3: Add Basic Project Structure, Launch File & README

#### Actions:

1. **Navigate to the Package Directory** :

```
   cd ~/catkin_ws/src/turtle_trajectory_pkg
```

1. **Create Project Directories** :

```
   mkdir scripts launch
   touch scripts/.gitkeep launch/.gitkeep
```

1. **Create a Basic Launch File** :

```
   nano launch/turtle_trajectory.launch
```

   Add the following content:

```
   <launch>
       <node pkg="turtlesim" type="turtlesim_node" name="turtlesim" output="screen"/>
   </launch>
```

1. **Test the Launch File** :

* Build your workspace:
  ```
  cd ~/catkin_ws
  catkin_make
  ```
* Source the workspace:
  ```
  source devel/setup.bash
  ```
* Test the launch file:
  ```
  roslaunch turtle_trajectory_pkg turtle_trajectory.launch
  ```
* Ensure that the `turtlesim` simulator runs successfully.

1. **Create a Basic README.md** :

```
   nano README.md
```

   Add the following content:

```
   # Turtle Trajectory Controller

   This package implements a ROS-based trajectory controller for the turtlesim simulator. Users can choose predefined trajectories (e.g., square, triangle, circular) or define custom point-to-point motions.

   ## Project Structure
   - **scripts/**: Contains Python scripts for trajectory control.
   - **launch/**: Contains launch files for running the simulation and node.
   - **README.md**: Project overview and usage instructions.

   ## Prerequisites
   - ROS installed on your system.
   - `turtlesim` package installed.

   ## Build Instructions
   1. Navigate to the Catkin workspace:
```

   cd ~/catkin_ws

```
   2. Build the workspace:
```

   catkin_make

```

   ## Run Instructions
   To launch the trajectory controller:
```

   roslaunch turtle_trajectory_pkg turtle_trajectory.launch

```

```

1. **Stage and Commit the Changes** :

```
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   git add src/turtle_trajectory_pkg/
   git commit -m "Add basic project structure, launch file, and README"
```
