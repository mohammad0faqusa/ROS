### **Commit Message for Step 4**

`Add initial turtle_trajectory.py skeleton`

---

### **Detailed Steps and Explanations**

1. **Create the Python Script** :

```bash
   nano turtle_trajectory.py
```

* **Explanation** : This command creates a new Python file called `turtle_trajectory.py`. This will be the main script that implements the logic for controlling the turtle's trajectory.

1. **Add Basic Python Script Skeleton** :
   Add the following code:

```python
   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import rospy

   def main():
       rospy.init_node('turtle_trajectory', anonymous=True)
       rospy.loginfo("Turtle Trajectory Node Initialized")
       rospy.spin()  # Keep the node running

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       main()
```

* **Explanation** :
  * `#!/usr/bin/env python3`: Specifies the interpreter to execute the script (`python3`).
  * `import rospy`: Imports the `rospy` library for writing ROS nodes in Python.
  * `rospy.init_node('turtle_trajectory', anonymous=True)`: Initializes a ROS node named `turtle_trajectory`. The `anonymous=True` flag ensures unique node names if multiple instances are running.
  * `rospy.loginfo("Turtle Trajectory Node Initialized")`: Logs a message to the console, confirming that the node has been successfully initialized.
  * `rospy.spin()`: Keeps the node running until it is shut down (e.g., via Ctrl+C).
  * The `main()` function encapsulates the core logic and is called when the script is executed.

1. **Make the Script Executable** :

```bash
   chmod +x turtle_trajectory.py
```

* **Explanation** : The `chmod +x` command makes the script executable. This allows it to be run directly from the terminal without needing to prefix it with `python3`.

1. **Test the Script** (Optional):
   Run the script to verify that the node initializes successfully:

   ```bash
   rosrun turtle_trajectory_pkg turtle_trajectory.py
   ```

   * **Explanation** : This command runs the script using ROS's `rosrun` utility. You should see the log message: `Turtle Trajectory Node Initialized` in the console, indicating that the node is running.
2. **Stage the Changes** :

```bash
   cd ~/catkin_ws
   git add src/turtle_trajectory_pkg/scripts/turtle_trajectory.py
```

* **Explanation** : Adds the new `turtle_trajectory.py` file to the staging area, preparing it for the commit.

1. **Commit the Changes** :

```bash
   git commit -m "Add initial turtle_trajectory.py skeleton"
```

* **Explanation** : Creates a commit with a clear message describing the addition of the initial Python script skeleton. This serves as a milestone in the project.

### **Why This Step is Important**

* **Sets the Foundation** : The skeleton provides a structured starting point for further development, ensuring the ROS node is properly initialized.
* **Allows Incremental Development** : Future enhancements, such as trajectory logic, can be added without reworking the basic structure.
* **Ensures Compatibility** : By using `rospy` and adhering to ROS conventions, this script can seamlessly integrate with other ROS packages and tools.
